#### Moodboard

![Moodboard](https://github.com/Cygnusfear/moodboard/blob/master/screenshot.png)

Throw a bunch of files in a directory,  show a moodboard. Delete with backspace. Drag into moodboard if you want more files. Doesn't save files you drag into it. Host it on Now, Netlify, whatever floats the boat. A rising tide lifts all boats.

It's a create-react-app that shows a simple pinterest-style moodboard of the pictures you want it to show. It's rather simple, style it, go wild on it, whatever fits the mood. b
